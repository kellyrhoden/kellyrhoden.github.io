# Kelly Rhoden - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! Here, I aim to showcase my passion for extracting insights from data and my evolving skills in the field of data analysis. This portfolio serves as a platform to exhibit my growth and proficiency in data analysis techniques, tools, and methodologies. Through various personal projects, I've honed my abilities in data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Each project reflects not only my technical proficiency but also my curiosity to delve deeper into different domains and uncover meaningful patterns. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find inspiration and value in my data-driven journey!

## Resources
I am a very hands-on, visual learner, so I'm always looking for new resources and tools online. Here are some of the resources I frequently use to reference and enhance my skills.
* [Best way to understand complex SQL statements? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/379062/best-way-to-understand-complex-sql-statements) - As someone relatively new to reading and writing more advanced SQL queries, I found this discussion helpful for understanding where to start when presented with a complex query.
* [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst/playlists) - Alex's channel has several useful playlists for topics like SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel. YouTube is a really useful resource for visual representation of concepts and real-world examples.
  
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3Schools is a useful reference for the basics of several languages, including SQL, Python, Python libraries, Excel, and even topics like statistics and data science.
  
* [StrataScratch](https://www.stratascratch.com/) - StrataScratch has a large library of coding and non-coding questions at a variety of difficulty levels to practice skills like SQL, Python, statistics, and modeling. As a free user, you also have access to some of the data projects.
  
* [DataLemur](https://datalemur.com/) - DataLemur is similar to StrataScratch in that it provides a library of questions at a variety of difficulty levels, but it also provides references for more advanced SQL functions like CTEs, subqueries, unions, and window functions.

* [Storytelling with Data (Website/Book)](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/) - Cole Nussbaum Knaflic has a lot of helpful resources in the realm of data visualization. In addition to her blog, I've also used her Storytelling with Data book as a resource for learning the principles of creating an effective visualization.

*  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) - Kaggle is another  helpful resource for finding datasets to practice with, and it also has a variety of learning paths you can take  to learn SQL, Python, data cleaning, geospatial analysis, and data visualization.
